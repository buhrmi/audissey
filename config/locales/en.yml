        <h3>Payouts</h3>
        <p>A payout to your account can be requested at any time from your dashboard page. You can not be paid out for events that have not started yet. A payout usually takes between 2 and 7 days but can take longer in individual cases.</p>
        <p>By default, we take a commission of 15% which is automatically deducted from your payout. Lower rates can be negotiated. The commission is used to improve the service and keep it alive.</p>
